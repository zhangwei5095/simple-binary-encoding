Simple Binary Encoding (SBE)
============================

[SBE](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-simple-binary-encoding) is an OSI layer 6 presentation for 
encoding and decoding binary application messages for low-latency financial applications. This repository contains 
the reference implementations in Java and C++.

Further details on the background and usage of SBE can be found on the
[Wiki](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/wiki).

An XSD for SBE specs can be found
[here](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/blob/master/sbe-tool/src/main/resources/fpl/sbe.xsd)

For the latest version information and changes see the [Change Log](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/wiki/Change-Log) with **downloads** at [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Csbe). 

This SBE implementation is designed with work very efficiently with the [Aeron](https://github.com/real-logic/Aeron) 
messaging system for low-latency and high-throughput communications. SBE has a dependency on [Agrona](https://github.com/real-logic/Agrona) 
for its buffer implementations.

Main source code

    sbe-tool/src/main

Unit tests

    sbe-tool/src/test

Samples of usage

    sbe-samples/src/main


Build
-----

The project is built with [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) using this [build.gradle](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/blob/master/build.gradle) file.

Full clean build:

    $ ./gradlew

Run the Java examples

    $ ./gradlew runJavaExamples


Distribution
------------
Jars for the executable, source, and javadoc for the various modules can be found in

    <module>/build/libs


C++ Build using CMake
---------------------
NOTE: Linux, Mac OS, and Windows only for the moment. See
[FAQ](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).
Windows builds have been tested with Visual Studio Express 12.

First build using gradle to generate the SBE jar.

    $ ./gradlew

For convenience, a script is provided that does a full clean, build, and test of all targets as a Release build.

    $ ./cppbuild/cppbuild

If you are comfortable with using CMake, then a full clean, build, and test looks like:

    $ mkdir -p cppbuild/Debug
    $ cd cppbuild/Debug
    $ cmake ../..
    $ cmake --build . --clean-first
    $ ctest
